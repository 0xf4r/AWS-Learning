The main difference between AWS and Azure PowerShell commands lies in the specific syntax and cmdlet names used to interact with each cloud provider's services. Here are some key distinctions:

1. Authentication:
  - AWS: Use the aws configure command to set up your access keys for AWS CLI or SDK authentication.
  - Azure: Use the Connect-AzAccount cmdlet to authenticate and connect to your Azure account.

2. Resource Management:
  - AWS: Services are typically managed through the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, with commands like aws ec2, aws s3, etc.
  - Azure: Use the Azure PowerShell module and cmdlets like New-AzResourceGroup, New-AzVM, New-AzStorageAccount, etc., to manage Azure resources.

3. Terminology:
  - AWS: Resources are organized into regions, availability zones, and services, using AWS-specific terminology like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.
  - Azure: Resources are organized into regions, resource groups, and services, using Azure-specific terminology like virtual machines (VMs), storage accounts, etc.

4. Scripting Language:
  - AWS: Supports scripting in various languages, including Python, Node.js, and PowerShell, using AWS SDKs and CLI.
  - Azure: Supports scripting in PowerShell, Azure CLI (cross-platform), and various programming languages via Azure SDKs.

5. Syntax and Cmdlet Names:
  - AWS: Commands typically follow a structure like aws <service> <action>, e.g., aws ec2 describe-instances.
  - Azure: Cmdlets generally follow a structure like <Verb>-Az<Noun>, e.g., New-AzVM, Get-AzStorageAccount.

It's important to note that while there are similarities in functionality and concepts between AWS and Azure, the specific implementation and syntax can vary. Familiarizing yourself with the documentation and resources for each cloud provider will help you navigate and utilize the appropriate commands effectively.
